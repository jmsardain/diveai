# Scuba diver helper 

By putting your latitude and longitude, the specs of your tank, the O2 percentage, the bottom time and your depth, this tool will give you: 

- The weather at your specific location (uses NOAA, only US for now) 
- The marine conditions at your specific location (uses NDBC, only US for now)
- The suggested dive plan (the author of the code is not responsible for your use of this information)
- The dive sites that are near your location 
- The marine life that are present at your location (uses INaturalist)
